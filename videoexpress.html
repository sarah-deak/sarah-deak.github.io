							<h4><strong>Reflection</strong></h4>
							<p style="font-size:.8em"><i>I find reflections to be the most important of any project. Why was it important to me? How did it help me grow as a designer? Why have I included this project on my portfolio? That is why I include my reflection before the project.</i></p>
								<p>This project was my first sponsor-led project at Purdue University. It was the first time I'd been on a team of UX designers for a project that was going into the industry- and I just think that's pretty cool. More than that, it was my first glimpse into how real <strong>industries use UX practices and principles and apply them to their projects</strong>. 
								<br>
								<br>
								This project didn't make me feel comfortable as a UX designer by any means- but it did give me the starting point. And hey, we all have to start somewhere.</p>

						<h4><strong>Project Overview</strong></h4>
						<p>Recently, more restaurants have started to adopt methods to communicate with their customers through websites such as Grubhub. These platforms tend to emphasize their own brand rather than that of the individual restaurants'. Fountain asked our team to develop the <strong>skeleton of a marketplace for the web </strong>that lowers the barrier of entry to an online platform for brick-and-mortar businesses. Our goal was to create a platform that will <strong>emphasize the agency of businesses to promote their own brand and personality </strong>through product and delivery services.</p>

						</ul>
						<p>In this project, my main role was <strong>championing documentation</strong>, which can be found using the link above. I also worked on many individual aspects of the project- Figma mockups, competitive analysis, evaluation of working prototypes, presentations in Keynote, and many others.</p>

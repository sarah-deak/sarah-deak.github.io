							<h4><strong>Reflection</strong></h4>
							<p style="font-size:.8em"><i>I find reflections to be the most important of any project. Why was it important to me? How did it help me grow as a designer? Why have I included this project on my portfolio? That is why I include my reflection before the project.</i></p>
								<p>Open-ended projects used to scare me. In fact, I purposely avoided them all the way up until this very project. Being told to create an IOT device from nothing was terrifying- and I never reflected upon my ability to create something from nothing until this project: I spent 4/5 of my time trying to find a direction, and coming up empty time after time.</strong> 
								<br>
								<br>
								My indecision on this project was my biggest fault- but what I ended up with was a "quick and dirty" prototype that worked for all intended purposes. <strong>It wasn't perfect, in fact it was everything but. But I loved it for that very reason- </strong> this project taught me to be a little less of a perfectionist, and gave me a new found appreciation for designing from nothing.</p>

						<h4><strong>Project Overview</strong></h4>
						<p>How can the experience of driving a car be altered to feel more embodied for a driver? For this project, I developed a possible Internet of Things solution to this question by using Arduino.
                        </p>
						</ul>
						<ul class="actions fit">
							<li><a href="documentation/IOT.pdf" target="_blank" class="button flex">See the full documentation ></a></li>
						</ul>
						
						<p>With my prototyped experience, when a driver enters the 
							car the music will automatically start playing. When a song comes on that the driver wants to 
							add to a playlist, they can simply hit the button and it will be added. Lastly, when the driver 
							exits the car, the music will automatically stop playing and the driver will receive a notification 
							to their phone reminding them to text someone if they need to.</p>
							<p>Below, you can see my Arduino circuit. You can also see the video demonstrating the device. </p>

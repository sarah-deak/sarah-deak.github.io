							<h4><strong>Reflection</strong></h4>
							<p style="font-size:.8em"><i>I find reflections to be the most important of any project. Why was it important to me? How did it help me grow? That is why I include my reflection before the project.</i></p>
								<p>I don't think I did a wonderful job with this project. It was outside my comfort zone, I didn't feel knowledgeable enough about the topic, and I overall felt that my ideas lacked the flair that critical designs are known for. However, I am extremely thankful I did this exercise in critical design- for without it, I never would've grown into the designer I am today.</strong>
								<br>
								<br>
								I never understood the criticality of questioning the world as we know it until I had to. <strong>We can't design without those questions.</strong></p>

						<h4><strong>Project Overview</strong></h4>
						<p>In this project, I chose to think critically about the social issue of gun violence. The ideas I presented did not necessarily reflect my personal opinion, and I am not extremely knowledgeable about gun laws or regulations. Gun laws in general tend to be a wicked issue- with currently no completely plausible alternatives, and I do not mean to suggest that I could fix this issue. With this
							exercise, I simply hoped to question and consider worlds we could one day live in.
                        </p>

						<h4><strong>Images & Short Explanations</strong></h4>
						<div class="row" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
							<article class="col-6 col-12-xsmall work-item">
								<img class="image" src="images/gunball.png" alt=""></a>
								<p>Initially, I wanted to use art to highlight the <strong>issues with lax gun control laws</strong> by considering a worst case of what could happen if we continue to be relaxed about those laws. The GunBall machine <strong>dispenses guns</strong>. This allows for easy access to guns from anywhere a person might need quick access to a gun- shopping centers, gas stations,children’s play areas, etc.</p>

							<article class="col-6 col-12-xsmall work-item">
								<img class="image" src="images/intentgun.png" alt=""></a>
								<p>Next, I wondered how we could <strong>change the pattern of gun violence</strong>. Here, I created the<strong> What’s Your Intent-gun</strong>? This gun has AI capabilities and uses it to detect the intention of the user. This gun also <strong>questions technology and intelligence</strong>, and whether AI will ever be smart enough to put the lives of humans on its shoulders. My design fiction further explores this.</p>

						<p><i>Each of these critical design pieces are accompanied by a storyboard-like design fiction. These can be found with explanations in the full project documentation.</i></p>
						<h4><strong>What skills did I practice during this project?</strong></h4>
								<li>Thinking critically about social issues</li>
								<li>Practicing critical design and design fictions</li>
								<li>Traversing a problem space I was highly uncomfortable in</li>

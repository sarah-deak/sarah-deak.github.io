							<h4><strong>Reflection</strong></h4>
							<p style="font-size:.8em"><i>I find reflections to be the most important of any project. Why was it important to me? How did it help me grow as a designer? Why have I included this project on my portfolio? That is why I include my reflection before the project.</i></p>
								<p>Ah, my very first UX project. I include this project on my portfolio not because I am proud of it- but because the memories of it are some of the most important in my life. I didn't know it until years later, but this project <strong>solidified my ability to be a UX designer</strong>. If I wasn't this project would've immediately weeded me out when I received a failing grade.</strong>. 
								<br>
								<br>
								<strong>What happened instead was a need to improve. </strong>I needed to get better, I needed to learn what I was doing wrong and fix it. Not everyone is like this, and not everyone feels it so inherently. Like I said, I didn't even realize until years later that this had even happened. This project was my very first encounter with my own growth mindset- and I passed the test I didn't even know I was taking.</p>

						<h4><strong>Project Overview</strong></h4>
						<p>Recently, more restaurants have started to adopt methods to communicate with their customers through websites such as Grubhub. These platforms tend to emphasize their own brand rather than that of the individual restaurants'. Fountain asked our team to develop the <strong>skeleton of a marketplace for the web </strong>that lowers the barrier of entry to an online platform for brick-and-mortar businesses. Our goal was to create a platform that will <strong>emphasize the agency of businesses to promote their own brand and personality </strong>through product and delivery services.</p>

							<li><a href="documentation/fountain.pdf" target="_blank" class="button flex">See the full documentation ></a></li>
						</ul>
						<p>In this project, my main role was <strong>championing documentation</strong>, which can be found using the link above. I also worked on many individual aspects of the project- Figma mockups, competitive analysis, evaluation of working prototypes, presentations in Keynote, and many others.</p>

						<h4><strong>Our process</strong></h4>
						<p>We broke our process down into three sprints.<br>
							Sprint 1: Primary & Secondary Research, Ideation, Desirability Testing<br>
							Sprint 2: Mood Board, Experience Map & Figma Prototyping<br>
							Sprint 3: Final Prototyping, Evaluation, Documentation/Handoff</p>
						<p>The main UX skills I gained in this project are:</p>
								<li>Conducting a competitive analysis</li>
								<li>Writing UX Documentation</li>
								<li>Conducting professional interviews with stakeholders</li>
								<li>Creating experience maps</li>
								<li>Figma Prototyping</li>

						<h4><strong>Project Overview</strong></h4>
						<p>The goals we had for this project were to modify an existing activity tracker application that links to a basic pedometer, <strong>empowering users to be healthier</strong> and to <strong>modify the mental model</strong> of what activities are beneficial, <strong>rewarding these behaviors over the behavior of cheating.</strong></p>
						<p>I am not going to go in-depth regarding this project. You can view the full documentation if you'd like, as it demonstrates best the process we went through. But the main reason I include this on my portfolio is as a reminder to myself that it is<strong> okay to fail.</strong> We were working with wicked problems, and weren't prepared to create wicked solutions. </p>

							<h4><strong>Reflection</strong></h4>
							<p style="font-size:.8em"><i>I find reflections to be the most important of any project. Why was it important to me? How did it help me grow as a designer? Why have I included this project on my portfolio?</i></p>
								<p>Ah, my very first UX project. I include this project on my portfolio not because I am proud of it- but because the memories of it are some of the most important in my life. I didn't know it until years later, but this project <strong>solidified my ability to be a UX designer</strong>. When I received that failing grade, I may have started to believe that I wasn't cut out for industry.</strong>
								<br>
								<br>
								<strong>What happened instead was a need to improve. </strong>I needed to get better, I needed to learn what I was doing wrong and fix it. I have learned overtime that not everyone has this inherent need- but I do. This project was my very first encounter with my own growth mindset- and I passed the test I didn't even know I was taking.</p>

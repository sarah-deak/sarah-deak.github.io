							<h4><strong>Reflection</strong></h4>
							<p style="font-size:.8em"><i>I find reflections to be the most important of any project. Why was it important to me? How did it help me grow as a designer? Why have I included this project on my portfolio? That is why I include my reflection before the project.</i></p>
								<p>Ah, my very first UX project. I include this project on my portfolio not because I am proud of it- but because the memories of it are some of the most important in my life. I didn't know it until years later, but this project <strong>solidified my ability to be a UX designer</strong>.When I received a failing grade, I could have decided I wasn't cut out for industry.</strong>. 
								<br>
								<br>
								<strong>What happened instead was a need to improve. </strong>I needed to get better, I needed to learn what I was doing wrong and fix it. Not everyone is like this, and not everyone feels it so inherently. Like I said, I didn't even realize until years later that this had even happened. This project was my very first encounter with my own growth mindset- and I passed the test I didn't even know I was taking.</p>

						<br>
						<h4><strong>Project Overview</strong></h4>
						<p>The goals we had for this project were: to modify an existing activity tracker application that links to a basic pedometer, <strong>empowering users to be healthier</strong> and to <strong>modify the mental model</strong> of what activities are beneficial, <strong>rewarding these behaviors over the behavior of cheating.</strong></p>
